                    <p>
                        Generative art is a revolutionary form of art that recently came through with the age of new technologies. Various algorithms and mathematical functions give birth to different work of arts, by genereating automated computer graphics. The artist creates a process that acts with some degree of autonomy to create a whole piece of art or a part of it. We could say that the artist adopts both the role of an artist and an engineer. Due to its way of functioning, this form of art can provide an unlimited amount of combinations of art work characteristics, such as color combinations, shapes, textures and art styles in general.<br/><br/> Generative Art Museum is an online platform that allows you to create your own work of generative art, share it with others, chat & collaborate with artists and developers and explore the endless possibilities of automated computer graphics. Accepting this form of art as a primitive art category is a highly controversial subject that the art community often brings up, since it's considered that it constitutes a creation of computers and code machines, similar to AI generated art. Nonetheless, we can't deny that there is surely an art in the process of learning how to engineer the autonomy and the mechanisms hidden behind the final results.
